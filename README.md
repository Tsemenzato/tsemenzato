Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

:technologist: I'm a Senior web developer based on the south of Argentina, mainly focused on Backend and DevOps.
<br/>
:briefcase: I'm currently working for [NaNLABS](https://www.nan-labs.com/), where i started as a Jr dev back in 2018.
<br/>
:black_heart: I'm really into cloud solutions and cybersecurity, the lattest being my biggest timesink outside working hours (Right after my car lol :wrench:)

I don't have much opensource experience. most of my work is for private clients, but if you're wondering what kind of code i write, I was practically raised as a developer through [Martin Fowler's Clean code book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/). So you'll see glimpses of it all over my stuff.
